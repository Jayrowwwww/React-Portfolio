                Hi! I’m a passionate and creative web developer with a strong focus on building clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces. My journey into web development began with a curiosity about how websites are built — and it quickly turned into a full-blown passion for turning design concepts into functional, interactive experiences. <br />
                <br />
            With a solid foundation in front-end development, I specialize in using React to build dynamic, component-based web applications. I love how React makes it easy to organize complex interfaces and bring real interactivity to the web. I pair this with Tailwind CSS to create beautifully styled, responsive layouts with clean, maintainable code — without the need to write endless lines of custom CSS. <br />
            <br />
            Before writing any code, I always start with a thoughtful design process. I use Figma to map out intuitive user interfaces, ensuring that every project I work on is both visually appealing and user-centered. From wireframes to high-fidelity prototypes, Figma allows me to bring structure and purpose to each design before development even begins. <br />
            <br />
            Whether I’m designing a sleek landing page, building reusable components, or optimizing performance, my goal is always the same: to create websites that are fast, accessible, and enjoyable to use. <br />
            <br />
            I’m always eager to learn new technologies, improve my existing skills, and collaborate with others who share a love for quality web development. This portfolio is a reflection of the work I’ve done so far — and I’m excited to keep growing and building even more. <br />
            <br />
            Thanks for stopping by — feel free to explore my projects, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect!
